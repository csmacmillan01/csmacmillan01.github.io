  <h2>Beyond the Resume</h2>

  <h3>Music & Performance</h3>
  <p>
    Classically trained guitarist under Croatian performer and educator 
    Natasha Klasinc-Lončar, with a performance background rooted in 
    disciplined solo and ensemble work. Debuted a contemporary piece by 
    composer Miroslav Lončar during senior recital, and was selected twice 
    for the All-Virginia Guitar Ensemble (VMEA), representing Dominion High School.
  </p>
  <p>
    Placed in the Aguado Classical Guitar Competition in both individual 
    and chamber ensemble categories. Today, I continue to play and sing 
    recreationally, balancing structured training with creative exploration.
  </p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p>
    Published creative nonfiction author, with work featured by 
    the Earl Gregg Swem Library at William & Mary. Writing serves as a 
    complementary discipline to analytics — refining clarity of thought, 
    narrative structure, and perspective.
  </p>

  <h3>Outdoors & Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    Eagle Scout with a longstanding appreciation for structured challenge, 
    team leadership, and time outdoors. Whether hiking along the Potomac 
    or exploring new trails, I value environments that require preparation, 
    resilience, and adaptability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often joined by my family’s German Shorthaired Pointer, Zorro.
  </p>

  <h3>Family & Balance</h3>
  <p>
    The oldest of three brothers and proud of it. Outside of academics and 
    professional work, much of my time is spent training at the gym, 
    playing pickup basketball, gaming, or planning the next small adventure together.
